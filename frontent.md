Excellent! Moving to the frontend with Next.js is a great next step. Let's outline a plan for building the frontend of your e-commerce site.

**1. Project Setup**

* **Next.js Project:**
    * Create a new Next.js project using `npx create-next-app@latest`.
    * Choose TypeScript for better type safety.
* **UI Library:**
    * Consider using a UI library like Material UI, Chakra UI, or Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and pre-built components.
* **State Management:**
    * For complex state management, consider using Redux Toolkit or Zustand.
    * For simpler scenarios, Next.js context API or React hooks might suffice.
* **HTTP Client:**
    * Use `axios` or `fetch` for making API requests to your backend microservices.
* **Authentication:**
    * Implement JWT authentication using the tokens received from your User service.
    * Store the JWT securely (e.g., using HTTP-only cookies or `localStorage` with caution).
* **Routing:**
    * Utilize Next.js's built-in file-based routing system.

**2. Pages and Components**

* **Authentication Pages:**
    * `/login`: User login page.
    * `/register`: User registration page.
* **Product Pages:**
    * `/products`: Displays a list of all products.
    * `/products/[id]`: Displays details of a specific product.
* **Cart Pages:**
    * `/cart`: Displays the user's shopping cart.
* **Order Pages:**
    * `/orders`: Displays the user's order history.
    * `/orders/[id]`: Displays details of a specific order.
* **Admin Pages:**
    * `/admin/products`: Admin page to manage products (add, update, delete).
    * `/admin/inventory`: Admin page to manage inventory.
* **Components:**
    * `ProductCard`: Displays a single product.
    * `CartItem`: Displays a single item in the cart.
    * `OrderItem`: Displays a single order item.
    * `ProtectedRoute`: A component to protect routes that require authentication.

**3. Functionality**

* **User Authentication:**
    * Implement login and registration forms.
    * Handle JWT authentication and storage.
    * Implement logout functionality.
* **Product Display:**
    * Fetch and display products from the Product service.
    * Implement product search and filtering.
    * Display product details.
* **Cart Management:**
    * Add items to the cart.
    * Remove items from the cart.
    * Update item quantities.
    * Clear the cart.
* **Order Processing:**
    * Create orders from the cart.
    * Display order history.
    * Display order details.
* **Admin Functionality:**
    * Add, update, and delete products.
    * Manage inventory levels.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Implement error handling for API requests and user input.
    * Display user friendly error messages.

**4. API Integration**

* Use `axios` or `fetch` to make API requests to your backend microservices.
* Handle API responses and errors.
* Include the JWT token in the authorization header of protected API requests.

**5. Security Considerations**

* Store JWTs securely.
* Implement input validation and sanitization.
* Use HTTPS for all API requests.
* Protect admin routes with proper authentication and authorization.


Let me know if you'd like to dive into a specific part of this plan, such as authentication, cart implementation, or admin functionality. We can break down each section into smaller, manageable steps.
